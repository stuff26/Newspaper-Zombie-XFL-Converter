# Newspaper-Zombie-XFL-Converter

This is a converter for the XFLs made by Newspaper Zombie (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10KsUxHu_9LJaSKAAaAeLCq2rSOmQCNHv). His assets are not game compatible, which will lead to tedious work by the user to convert them. This converter will handle the tedious work.

What the converter will do is:
- Move all keyframes from the main document to main_sprite
- Split up layers that use multiple different symbols
- Organize the library into image, sprite, and media
- Fix the names of symbols

Please note of the following:
1. The converter handles most of the tedious work, however, it will NOT do everything. Some symbols and bimaps that can't be fixed automatically will be placed in a separate folder, which will be required by the user to fix.
